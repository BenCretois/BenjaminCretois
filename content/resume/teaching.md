As I am developping lectures and exercises for some courses at NTNU I wanted to make the material that I prepare for the courses to everyone. I hope this can be useful for some of you!

### GEOG3006: Quantitative methods

This course is an introduction to statistics in R at a master level. We first introduce the students to R through a list of tutorials and we then introduce them to statistics. The course emphasize heavily on regressions and we do not carry out any "statistical tests".

### GEOG2015: Introduction to GIS and Quantitative methods

This course teaches the principles of GIS and descriptive statistics. Initially made with the SPSS software I converted the exercises for the students to use R. Some exercises require the use of ArcGIS Pro. All dataset for the R exercises are in the GitHub repo of this website

### GEOG3527: GIS Tools for Climate Change Studies

This course use primarily ArcGIS Pro as the main GIS software. However, because of the COVID-19 pandemic some students didn't get access to the software. I have made some alternative exercises students could do in R so they could complete the semester.
