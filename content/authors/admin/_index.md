My name is Benjamin Cretois and I am a now a **data scientist** at the [Norwegian Institute for Nature Research](https://www.nina.no/). My work consists in using Machine learning and statistics to help researchers in their project. At the moment I am mainly involved in projects aiming to **identify and classify sound and images** from different ecosystems.

Previously, I have done my PhD in **spatial data analysis** at the Department of Geography at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. My PhD took place within the project [Transforming Citizen Science for Biodiversity](https://citizenscience.no/), a project which aim to improve the way we use Citizen Science to improve biodiversity conservation.

When I am not in front of my computer I am certainly under a rock trying to climb it or under a wave while trying to surf in my hometown in Normandie. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
