My name is Benjamin Cretois and I am a PhD Student in **spatial data analysis** at the Department of Geography at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. I am under the supervision of [Jan Ketil Rød](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/jan.rod), [John Linnell](https://www.nina.no/english/Contact/Employees/Employee-info/AnsattID/12310) and [Erlend Nilsen](https://www.nina.no/kontakt/Ansatte/Ansattinformasjon.aspx?AnsattID=12833). My PhD takes place within the project [Transforming Citizen Science for Biodiversity](https://citizenscience.no/), a project which aim to improve the way we use Citizen Science to improve biodiversity conservation.

My research focus primarily on finding statistical methods to **better use Citizen Science data** for making better inference regarding species ecology. My expertise largely lies in data analysis and GIS (with a great love for both R and Python). I recently found an interest in **Bayesian statistics** and **Deep learning** which I pretend I understand.

When I am not in front of my computer I am certainly rolling on a tatami while doing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or under a wave while trying to surf in my hometown in Normandie. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
