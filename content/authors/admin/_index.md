My name is Benjamin Cretois and I am a PhD Student at the Department of Geography at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology under the supervision of [Jan Ketil Rød](https://www.ntnu.no/ansatte/jan.rod), [John Linnell](https://www.nina.no/english/Contact/Employees/Employee-info/AnsattID/12310) and [Erlend Nilsen](https://www.nina.no/kontakt/Ansatte/Ansattinformasjon.aspx?AnsattID=12833). My PhD takes place within the project Transforming Citizen Science for Biodiversity, a project which aim to improve the way we use Citizen Science.

My research focus primarily on finding ways to better use Citizen Science observations to produce better species distribution maps. I also have a big interest in human-wildlife coexistence, particularly when it involves ungulates and carnivores. My expertise lies in GIS and spatial analysis and I recently found an interest in Bayesian statistics and Point process models which I pretend I understand.

When I am not in front of my computer I am certainly doing Mixed Martial Arts or surfing in Portugal. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions!
